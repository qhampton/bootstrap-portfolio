                <p> I am a database specialist, student, and dog mom. After graduating UC- San Diego, I have been lucky
                    enough
                    to call San Diego my home for 7 years now and even luckier to have found a place in University
                    Heights. Even
                    though I have only lived there for a year, it is one of the best neighborhoods I have ever lived in.
                    Before
                    transplanting to SoCal, I was NorCal bred from Hayward and all around the Bay. When I am not
                    working, I like
                    to switch amongst a multitude of hobbies; from HIIT, open ocean swimming, attempting a new craft –
                    trying
                    acrylic painting right now, playing video games from console to phone, playing tabletop games- such
                    as Magic
                    the Gathering to Monopoly, reading, or my favorite – trying new restaurants/food places! Oh, and if
                    I may
                    say so I am a crane game wiz! I play at various Round One arcades and my goal is to win in two moves
                    or
                    less. Below is a photo of my last haul. I then sell them.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-12">
                <img src="https://github.com/qhampton/basic-portfolio/blob/master/assets/images/crane-wins.jpg?raw=true"

                <br>
                <p> As a database specialist, what I do is if something broken with the applications we use; I go in the
                    backend, find out why, then fix it. When I am not doing that, I am helping users with their clinical
                    studies
                    from the creation to closure dealing with calendar input, survey customization, and patient
                    management.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-12">
                <p> I honestly fell into the IT sector. After school, B.S. in hand, I was like, "well now what?" I knew
                    I was
                    not ready for a PhD. I mean one topic for your entire academic career- as you can see from above, I
                    do not
                    even have a narrow field of hobby interest. I had a wide experience in career choice from working in
                    biotech
                    companies to a hostess for Cocos – man the pies. So, I was stuck with the question everyone faces in
                    there
                    like: what do you want to do? And like many who do not have a definitive answer, I turned to UCSD
                    temp to
                    help place me somewhere because -well food and housing is a nice thing to have. However, little did
                    I know
                    this is where I would find my passion and hunger to learn more about computers, but specifically
                    what makes
                    them work.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-12">
                <p> So here I am now - excitingly here kicking my new career into over-drive. All thrusters go! I have
                    never
                    been more scared and thrilled in my life. My dad always says, “when one door closes, there is a
                    window open
                    somewhere”. The best part is the skill I will gain in these next 24 weeks are not opening windows
                    and doors
                    but tearing down the walls entirely to this entirely new realm. I can use my skills to advance
                    research and
                    the healthcare world, or dive into the tech world and sharpen my building finesse.</p>
