# bootstrap-portfolio
Week 2 HW: Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
- A navbar
- A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)
  -eg. On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and      right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!
- Responsive images
